Oh, Ms. Yumi!······· I'm glad I ran into you.	오, 유미 선생님!······· 이렇게 만나서 정말 다행이에요.
Have you had a chance to grade our exams yet?	우리 시험 채점해보셨어요?
Uhhhhhh,········ remind me what that was on again.	으으으으········ 그게 뭐였는지 다시 좀 알려줘.

Later.····· Next week,·· probably.········ I'm sure you did fine Tiffany.	나중에····· 다음 주쯤,·· 아마도.········ 티파니, 너 잘했을 거야.
You think?········ I hope·· so.·················· I don't know, I was having trouble with some of the material.	그럴까?········ 나도 그러길 바라·················· 근데 잘 모르겠어, 몇 개는 너무 어렵더라고.
Do you know what we're going over next week?····· I'd like to try to get a head start this time.	다음 주에 뭘 배우는지 알아?····· 이번엔 미리 좀 준비해보고 싶어서.

Actually,····· I have a pounding headache right now.····· Can we do this later please?	사실····· 지금 머리가 너무 지끈거려서····· 이따가 해도 될까?
Yeah,····· okay.······· Sorry to bother you Ms. Yumi.	응,····· 알겠어요.······· 신경 쓰게 해서 미안해요, 유미 씨.
No,····· it's fine.················· I'll talk to you later.	아니,······ 괜찮아.·················· 나중에 얘기할게.
Whoa.······· Is·· this·· chick·· serious?····· That school girl uniform is a little on the nose don't cha think?	와······ 이··여자··진심이야?····· 그 교복은 너무 노골적인 거 아냐?
She's cute though.··· Blonde too, so ah... bonus points!	근데 걔 귀엽잖아.··· 금발이기도 하고, 음... 가산점이지!
This is your classic girl next door situation.····· She's nice,··· so don't say anything to scare her off.	이건 딱 전형적인 옆집 소녀 상황이야.····· 그녀는 착하니까,··· 괜히 겁줄 만한 말은 하지 마.
But don't be afraid to take a chance!	하지만 기회가 있다면 망설이지 마!
Excuse me, do you know where I can find the student union?	저기요, 학생회관이 어디 있는지 아세요?
I sure do!········ I know this place inside and out.	그럼!········ 이곳 구석구석까지 다 꿰고 있지.
You go past the building here··· and take a left at the fountain.····· You can't miss it.	여기 건물 지나서··· 분수대에서 왼쪽으로 꺾으면 돼.····· 절대 못 놓칠 거야.
Hey, don't take this the wrong way, but I just thought you were cute and had to say hi.	저기, 오해하지 말고 들어줘. 그냥 너가 너무 귀여워서 인사하고 싶었어.
Who?··· me?················· Ohhh, no!······· I'm·· so·· not·· cute...············· but thanks for the compliment!	누구요?··· 저요?················· 어어, 아니에요!······· 저·· 전혀·· 귀엽지·· 않아요...············· 그래도 칭찬해줘서 고마워요!
Would it be too forward of me to ask you on a date?	나랑 데이트하자고 바로 물어보면 너무 들이대는 걸까?
Oh,····· wow.······· Uhhh...················ I'm not sure.················· I don't even know you.	어,······와.······· 어...················ 잘 모르겠는데.················· 나 너에 대해 아는 것도 없잖아.
I haven't seen you around here before.····· Are you starting this semester?	여기서 처음 보는 얼굴인데······ 이번 학기부터 시작하는 거야?
I teach here. Professor Handsome they call me.	여기서 가르쳐. 애들이 나보고 잘생긴 교수님이라 부르거든.
I teach here. Professor Sexy they call me.	여기서 강의해. 섹시 교수님이라고들 부르더라.
*hehehehe* Come on,·· give me a break.····· Stop teasing me!	*헤헤헤헤* 아~ 진짜, 좀 봐줘.···· 이제 그만 놀려!
No, but if all the girls here are as cute as you I might have to reconsider.	아니, 근데 여기 여자애들이 다 너만큼 귀엽다면 나 생각 좀 다시 해봐야겠다.
What?····· You're crazy,····· stop it.	뭐야?····· 너 미쳤어,····· 그만해.
I'm thinking about it. Would you recommend this school?	생각 중이야. 너라면 이 학교 추천할래?
Of course!····· This place is awesome.····· My professors are the best.	그럼!····· 이곳 진짜 끝내줘.····· 교수님들도 최고야.
You strike me as an athletic type. You on a varsity team?	너 운동 좀 할 것 같은데? 학교 대표팀 같은 거 해봤어?
Oh my god,····· yeah!·········· That's so crazy,··· how did you know?	오 마이 갓,····· 그래!·········· 진짜 대박이야,··· 어떻게 알았어?
I'm on the cheerleading team;······· the cheer captain to be exact.	나 치어리딩 팀이야·······, 정확히 말하면 치어리더 주장이지.
Sorry, am I holding you up from getting to class?	미안, 내가 수업 가는 길 막고 있는 거 아니야?
No!····· Don't worry about it.····· I'm all done with classes for now.	안 돼!····· 신경 쓰지 마.····· 나 수업은 이제 다 끝났어.
If I end up going here, you'll have to show me around.	나중에 내가 여기 오게 되면, 너가 안내해줘야겠다.
Yeah!····· I'd love that.····· It's really a beautiful campus too.	응!····· 나 완전 좋지.····· 캠퍼스도 진짜 예뻐.

You seem like a cool girl.·········· Hopefully I'll see you around campus!	너 진짜 멋진 애 같아.·········· 캠퍼스에서 또 봤으면 좋겠다!
This...···················· is the one?	이게...···················· 진짜 그거야?
That's the guy.	저 사람이야.
That's the girl.	그게 바로 그 여자야.
How is that possible?·········· I····· don't understand...	어떻게 그런 일이 가능해?·········· 나····· 이해가 안 돼...
I know.····· Believe me,··· I know.····· I'm just as surprised as you, but,····· that's him.·····	알아.····· 정말이야,··· 나도 알아.····· 나도 너만큼 놀랐거든, 근데····· 저 사람이야.·····

*aaaacc*········· Alright...········ I'll handle this.·········· You're dismissed.	*아아아앗*········· 좋아...········ 내가 처리할게.·········· 이제 가도 돼.
Have fun!	재밌게 놀아!
Sooooo,················· you're good with women,····· are you?	흠················· 너 여자한테 좀 먹힌다는 거야,····· 그렇지?
To whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?	누구랑 얘기하게 된 영광이죠?
Quiet!············ I'll get to that in a moment.	조용히 해!············ 그건 좀 있다가 할 거야.
The best in the business.	업계 최고.
You appear to have the confidence for it, at least.	적어도 자신감은 있어 보이네.
How do you people get into my house?	도대체 너희는 어떻게 내 집에 들어오는 거야?
Shhhhh!····· I'll be asking the questions.	쉿!····· 질문은 내가 할 거야.
You see,····· I've been hearing some very impressive reports from Kyu.	있잖아····· 큐가 너에 대해 아주 인상적인 소문들을 들려줬거든.
Reports that have me very,····· very...····· interested.	나를 엄청····· 엄청...····· 흥미롭게 만드는 보고서들이야.
Apparently you've been with every beautiful girl in your town...········ within a remarkably short time...	듣자하니 넌 너네 동네 예쁜 여자들은 거의 다 만나봤다면서…········ 그것도 엄청 짧은 시간 안에…
I've never heard of anything like it before...	난 그런 얘기 처음 들어봐...
What can I say? I'm just that good.	뭐라 할까? 내가 워낙 잘하잖아.
Yeeeeessssss,····· well we'll see about that.	그래에에에에에,····· 음, 두고 보자고.
I'm just doing what Kyu told me to do.	그냥 큐가 시키는 대로 하는 거야.
This is no time for modesty!	지금은 부끄러워할 때가 아니야!
I suppose I have improved quite a bit...	나도 꽤나 많이 늘었네...
In···deed.············· But the question remains...····· how good are you?	그렇······지.·············· 하지만 여전히 남는 질문이 하나 있네...····· 너, 얼마나 잘하는 거야?
If you're to ultimately prove yourself,····· there is one final challenge...	네가 정말로 실력을 증명하고 싶다면······ 마지막 시험이 남아 있어...
*hahahahahaha*····· You're looking at her.·········· Venus,····· the goddess of love.	*하하하하하하*····· 너 지금 그녀를 보고 있잖아.·········· 비너스,····· 사랑의 여신.
If you can claim the love of a goddess,·········· you will truly become a legend.	여신의 사랑을 손에 넣을 수 있다면·········· 정말 전설이 될 거야.
I can assure you however·········· that this is no simple task.	하지만 분명히 말할 수 있는 건·········· 이게 결코 쉬운 일이 아니라는 거야.
Few have tried,····· but all have failed.····· No human has ever known my embrace.	시도한 사람은 드물었지······ 하지만 전부 실패했어.······ 인간은 단 한 번도 내 품을 안아본 적 없어.
I consider it an honor to accept your challenge.	당신의 도전을 받아들이게 되어 영광이야.
I am rock hard right now, you have no idea.	나 지금 완전 단단해졌어, 너 진짜 모를 거야.
I am so wet right now, you have no idea.	지금 완전 젖었어, 너는 상상도 못 할 걸.
You're on lady.	좋았어, 받아주지.
*hahahahahahahahahahahahaha*·····*ccaaaacc*········ Good luck...	*푸하하하하하하하하하하하하*·····*카아아악*········ 행운을 빈다...
Whohohoooa!!····· That.·········· Was.·········· Awesome!·········· I saw the whole thing.····· I can't believe you nailed my boss!	우오오오오!!····· 그거·········· 진짜·········· 대박이야!·········· 다 봤어.····· 네가 내 상사랑 그렇게 했다는 게 믿기지가 않아!
I mean····· I've heard stories,····· but I've never seen anybody actually pull it off.	그러니까······ 듣긴 들었는데,······ 진짜로 해내는 사람은 처음 봐.
*cccc*·····Was she as good as I imagine?	*cccc*·····내가 상상한 만큼 끝내줬어?
She was incredible. There are no words to describe that kind of pleasure.	그녀는 정말 대단했어. 그런 쾌감을 표현할 말이 없네.
Awwww··· man!····· Alright····· stop,····· stop.····· I can't believe I'm jealous of you right now.	아아아··· 진짜!····· 알았어····· 그만,····· 그만해.····· 내가 지금 너를 질투하고 있다니, 믿기지가 않아.
Ehh, you know. It was alright.	음, 그냥 뭐. 그럭저럭 괜찮았어.
*hehe*Yo,····· shut······· up.········· You're killin' my dream.····· You know you loved it.	*헤헷* 야,······ 조용히 해········· 내 꿈 다 깨잖아.····· 너도 좋았으면서.
Yeah, but not half as good as you.	그래도 너만큼은 아니지.
*hahahaha*·····Well,····· yeah,····· I am pretty good...	*하하하하*······응,······ 나 꽤 잘하지...
Mmmmm,····· I'm not even sure what else to say.	으으으,····· 뭐라고 더 해야 할지 모르겠네.
It feels like just a couple of days ago you could barely get a sentence out in front of a cute girl.	불과 며칠 전만 해도 귀여운 여자애 앞에선 제대로 말도 못 하던 네가 이렇게 됐다니.
Now you're bangin' 'em out left and right.·····*cccc*····· I guess I'm better at my job than I thought...	이제 너 완전 일사천리로 해치우고 있네.·····*cccc*····· 내가 생각한 것보다 훨씬 일 잘하는데, 나?
Hey! I'm the one who did all the work!	야! 일은 내가 다 했잖아!
Oh··· please!····· You'd still be crying yourself to sleep if it wasn't for me.	아··· 제발!····· 나 아니었으면 아직도 밤마다 울면서 잠들고 있었을걸?
Wait, so like, do you have sex with all your clients?	잠깐, 그럼 너 모든 고객들이랑 다 섹스하는 거야?
Yeah,····· pretty much.····· What can I say?····· I'm kind of a slut.	응,····· 맞아.····· 뭐 어쩌겠어?····· 나 좀 막 살아서.
You're the best. Thanks for everything you taught me.	너 진짜 최고야. 나한테 이것저것 가르쳐줘서 정말 고마워.
Don't mention it.····· It's like I said,··· I'm just doing my job.	별 말씀을요.······ 아까도 말했잖아요,··· 전 그냥 제 일 하는 것뿐이에요.
I'll admit it though, you did good.····· Real good.····· I'm proud of ya!	솔직히 인정할게, 너 진짜 잘했어.····· 아주 잘했지.····· 내가 다 뿌듯하다!
There's really only one place to go from here...····· one final challenge.········· If you think you're up for it...	이제 여기서 갈 수 있는 곳은 단 한 군데뿐이야... 마지막 도전이지.······ 정말 할 자신 있다면 말이야...
Didn't Venus say she was the final challenge?	비너스가 마지막 도전이라고 하지 않았어?
*cccc*·····Why you gotta be like that?····· Will you cut me a break over here?	*cccc*·····왜 그렇게 구는 건데?····· 여기서 좀 봐주면 안 돼?
I'm in! Let's do it. Whatcha got?	나도 할래! 해보자. 뭐 준비했어?
That's what I'm talkin' about!········ I had a feeling you'd be down.	바로 그거지!········ 네가 흔쾌히 오케이 할 줄 알았어.
Nah that's okay. I'm kinda sex'd out.	아니, 괜찮아. 나 이제 좀 질린 것 같아.
Uhhhh...····· what?········· Whatever.··········· I'll explain it anyway incase you change your mind.	어... 뭐라고? ……… 뭐 어때. …… 혹시 마음이 바뀔까봐 일단 설명은 해줄게.
The final challenge is called "Alpha Mode".····· In alpha mode,····· the difficulty will be locked into the "Hard" setting.	최종 도전 과제는 바로 "알파 모드"야.····· 알파 모드에선····· 난이도가 "어려움"으로 고정돼.
Dates will continue to increase in difficulty, indefinitely.····· The question is,··· how far can you get?	데이트는 점점 더 어려워질 거야, 끝도 없이.····· 문제는··· 네가 어디까지 갈 수 있냐는 거지?
Sounds fun,····· right?·········· It is!·············· But,············ we need to make sure you're really prepared for it.	재미있을 것 같지,····· 그렇지?·········· 재밌어!·············· 그런데,············ 네가 진짜 준비됐는지 확인해봐야 해.
So before I activate "Alpha Mode",····· I'm going to need you to fork over those panties.	"알파 모드"를 활성화하기 전에····· 너 그 팬티 먼저 내놔야겠어.
All together I need twelve pairs of panties from you;····· each pair from a different girl.	총 열두 장의 팬티가 필요해····· 각각 다른 여자애들 걸로 부탁해.
So if you got 'em,····· hand 'em over!····· I'll be waiting!	그러니까 있으면······ 얼른 내놔!······ 기다릴게!
Hi there!	안녕!
HI!! HELLO!!	안녕!! 헬로!!
Wow,····· okay.····· Could I get you to maybe take it down a notch?· I'm· right here.	와······ 알겠어.······ 혹시 좀 진정해줄 수 있어? 나 바로 옆에 있거든.
Uhhhhh...	으으으으...
Ummm, hello?·········· Is anybody home?	저기, 안녕하세요?·········· 집에 누구 계세요?
What? Who... me?	뭐? 누구... 나?
Yeah, you!	그래, 너!
Oh, sorry. I just... don't talk to many girls.	아, 미안. 그냥... 여자랑 많이 얘기해본 적이 없어서.
Well you're talking to one now,··· champ.	지금 바로 눈앞에 있잖아,··· 챔프.
You're like really, really cute.	너 진짜, 진짜 귀엽다.
I know right?····· It's crazy.	그치?····· 완전 미쳤다니까.
I think I'm in love with you.	나 너한테 반한 것 같아.
Ooo···kaaaayy,········ maybe we can take a step back here.	으으···알겠어········ 잠깐 한걸음 물러날까?
My name is Kyu;····· nice to meet you.	내 이름은 큐야····· 만나서 반가워.
Kyu? That's a weird name.	큐? 좀 특이한 이름이네.
Oh thanks.········ No that's great,····· I have a weird name.·····	아, 고마워.········ 아니야, 진짜 좋아,····· 내 이름이 좀 이상하거든.·····
You mean, like, the letter?	그니까, 그 편지 말하는 거야?
Nope.····· Not like that at all.	아니야····· 전혀 그런 게 아냐.
I literally can't remember my name right now.	지금 내 이름조차 기억이 안 나.
Riiiiiight.··············· We'll try that again later.	그으으으렇지··············· 나중에 다시 해보자.
Look dude,····· are you gonna be alright?····· Looks like you're having some trouble holding it together over there.	야, 있잖아····· 너 괜찮을 거야?····· 저기서 완전 멘탈 나가는 것 같은데.
Look girl,····· are you gonna be alright?····· Looks like you're having some trouble holding it together over there.	저기, 저기····· 괜찮을 것 같아?····· 지금 완전 멘붕 온 것처럼 보이는데?
Hmm? Nah, I'm chill, I'm chill.	음? 아니야, 나 괜찮아, 진짜 괜찮아.
Psssh!····· That's a fat load of shit and you know it.	쳇!····· 그건 그냥 개소리라는 거 너도 알잖아.
What do you mean? I'm fine.	무슨 말이야? 나 괜찮은데.
What do I mean?····· I mean I can literally see you sweating through your shirt.	내 말이 무슨 뜻이냐면······ 네 셔츠에 땀이 비치는 게 다 보여, 정말로.
Oh, no I just... Uhhh, I just...	아, 아니 그게... 으으, 그냥...
You just... You just...····· Yeah, that's what I thought.	너 그냥... 너 그냥...······ 그래, 그럴 줄 알았어.
Shit... Yeah, sorry. I should just go.	젠장... 아, 미안. 그냥 갈게.
Or you could just stop being so weird about it.	아니면 그냥 그렇게 이상하게 굴지만 말지.
Is it that obvious?	그렇게 티 나?
I could see how uncomfortable you are right now from space.	지금 너 얼마나 불편한지 우주에서도 보이겠다.
Well, it's just that... you're so pretty and stuff.	그게... 너 너무 예쁘고 그래서.
Oh god,·· did you just say that?····· Is this happening?	세상에,··· 너 지금 정말 그렇게 말한 거야?····· 이게 진짜 현실이야?
Hmmmmm,····· wait,····· you know what?····· This might actually work...	음음음······ 잠깐만,······ 있잖아?······ 이거 진짜 먹힐지도 모르겠다······
Yeah,····· yeah... Oh man, this is your lucky day buddy!	그래,····· 그래... 와, 오늘 완전 운 좋은 날이네, 친구!
Yeah,····· yeah... Oh man, this is your lucky day sister!	그래,······ 그래... 와, 오늘 진짜 네 날이네, 언니!
Listen,····· I gotta go.····· But, we'll meet again, real soon.····· Trust me.	있잖아····· 나 이제 가봐야 해.····· 하지만 우리 곧 다시 만나게 될 거야.····· 믿어줘.
Niiight!	잘 자~!
Hey, you!····· Rise and shine!····· We've got work to do.	야, 너!····· 일어나라구!····· 할 일이 산더미야.
I said····· GET UP!	일어났다고······ 얼른 일어나!
Mmmm, five more minutes...	으으응, 딱 5분만 더...
No way dude.····· No time to waste!	말도 안 돼, 야.····· 시간 없잖아!
No way girlfriend.····· No time to waste!	말도 안 돼, 자기야.····· 이제 시간 없어!
Alright, alright... I'm up... I'm... zZzZzZz...	알았어, 알았어... 일어났어... 나... 쿨쿨쿨...
Am I gonna have to pull the covers off?	이불을 내가 직접 걷어줘야겠어?
Aww, I was having the best dream...	아, 진짜 좋은 꿈 꾸고 있었는데...
*hmmm*···I bet you were...	*흠흠*···네가 그랬을 것 같아...
Wha, wait! Who are you!?	뭐, 잠깐만! 너 누구야!?
That getup... I'm definitely still dreaming.	저 복장... 나 아직 꿈 꾸고 있는 거 맞지.
Afraid not.····· This is totally happening.	아니, 안 돼.····· 이거 진짜 일어나는 거야.
How did you get in here? I'm calling the police.	여기 어떻게 들어온 거야? 경찰 부를 거야.
Chill out for a second.····· You'll be glad I showed up.	진정 좀 해봐.····· 내가 와서 다행일걸.
Don't you recognize this adorable face?····· *hehe*It's·· Kyu,·· from the bar.	이 귀여운 얼굴 기억 안 나?····· *헤헤* 나야,·· 그 바에서 봤던·· 큐.
Yeah... but you had brown hair. Also, not wings.	맞아... 근데 너는 갈색 머리였잖아. 그리고 날개도 없었고.
Clever disguise,····· right?····· I can change my hair any color I want.····· It's pretty sweet.	완벽한 변장이지,····· 맞지?····· 머리색도 내가 원하는 대로 바꿀 수 있어.····· 꽤 멋지지?
Huh... Did you... I mean... Did we...?	어... 너 혹시... 그러니까... 우리...?
*hahahahahaha*·····No...······· no.······· God no.·········· Besides,····· I was on the clock.	*푸하하하하하*·····아냐...······ 아니야.······ 제발 아니라고.·········· 게다가····· 난 근무 중이었어.
I'm so confused right now. What's going on?	나 지금 완전 혼란스러워. 무슨 일이야?
*hhmmmm*·····Why are they always confused?	음흠·····왜 항상 그렇게 헷갈려 하는 거지?
If you can't tell by now,····· I'm a fairy.··· Well,··· a love fairy to be exact.	이제쯤 눈치챘겠지만····· 난 요정이야.··· 정확히 말하면,··· 사랑의 요정이지.
Okay. But, fairies aren't actually a thing.	알겠어. 하지만, 요정은 실제로 존재하지 않잖아.
Common misconception.····· I assure you that fairies are indeed,····· a thing.	흔한 오해야.····· 요정은 진짜로 존재한다고 장담할 수 있어.·····
Question. What exactly is a love fairy?	질문. 사랑 요정이란 도대체 뭐야?
Good question.····· I'm glad you asked.	좋은 질문이네.····· 물어봐줘서 기뻐.
Ohhh! Well why didn't you just say so?	오~! 그럼 그냥 그렇게 말하지 그랬어?
*aaacccc*·····Funny,········ but let's leave the sarcasm to me,········ alright?	*aaacccc*·····웃기네,········ 하지만 빈정거리는 건 나한테 맡기자,········ 알았지?
Ya see,··· as a love fairy,· it's my job to help poor saps like you out with the ladies.····· It's just...·· what I do.	있잖아,··· 난 사랑의 요정이거든,· 그래서 너처럼 여자한테 서툰 애들 도와주는 게 내 일이야.······ 원래·· 그게 내 일이거든.
Ya see,··· as a love fairy,· it's my job to help poor gals like you out with the ladies.····· It's just...·· what I do.	있잖아··· 나는 사랑의 요정이라서, 너같이 여자한테 서툰 애들 좀 도와주는 게 내 일이거든.······ 그냥·· 내가 하는 일이야.
I don't like to brag,····· but I'll have you know I have a very impressive track record.	잘난 척은 별로 안 하지만····· 나 꽤 대단한 전적 있는 사람이라고?
All of my previous clients are basically walking babe magnets now.	내가 도와줬던 사람들은 지금 다 여자들이 줄줄 따라다니는 남자들이 됐거든.
You, though...··· *cccmmccc*········Let's just say, you will be my greatest accomplishment yet.	너 말이지... ··· *cccmmccc*········ 지금까진 아무것도 아니었어. 넌 내 최고의 걸작이 될 거야.
Thanks but no thanks. I'm doing just fine on my own.	고맙지만 사양할게. 나 혼자서도 잘 지내니까.
*haaah*·····No, but seriously.	*하아아*······진짜로, 농담 아니고.
Why do you want to help me? What's in it for you?	왜 나를 도와주고 싶은데? 너한테 뭐 이득이라도 있어?
Man,····· you and all the questions.····· Can't a fairy just help a brother out?	아이고····· 넌 왜 이렇게 질문이 많냐.····· 요정도 좀 도와줄 수 있잖아?
Man,····· you and all the questions.····· Can't a fairy just help a sister out?	아, 정말······ 너는 왜 이렇게 질문이 많니?······ 요정도 그냥 한 번 도와줄 순 없는 거야?
I'm still having a hard time accepting the fairy thing. It kinda crushes my reality.	아직도 요정 얘기는 잘 받아들이기 힘들어. 현실이 완전 붕괴되는 느낌이야.
*aaaccc*·····It's fine,····· just go with it;····· it's gonna be great.	*aaaccc*·····괜찮아,····· 그냥 따라와;····· 진짜 끝내줄 거야.
We need to get started right away.····· Tell me,····· how many dates HAVE you been on?	우리 지금 바로 시작해야 해.····· 말해 봐,····· 데이트 몇 번이나 해봤어?
Like actual dates with physical girls?	진짜 여자들이랑 실제로 데이트한다고?
I mean, you know, an amount.	내 말은, 있잖아, 어느 정도냐고.
Define "date".	"데이트"가 뭔지 말해봐.
Oh··· my··· god,····· it's worse than I thought,····· isn't it?	아··· 세상에··· 이거 내가 생각한 것보다 더 심각한 거 아니야?
Alright,··· grab your shit,····· we're going on a date,··· right now.····· Someone has to show you the ropes.	좋아,··· 네 짐 챙겨,····· 지금 바로 데이트하러 간다.····· 누군가는 네가 어떻게 하는지 알려줘야 하잖아.
I know a place nearby that's open pretty late.····· You'll love it.····· Or not;··· I don't care.	근처에 늦게까지 하는 데가 있어.····· 분명 맘에 들 거야.····· 아니면 말고;··· 신경 안 써.
Alright,····· I'll try to make this quick.	알겠어,····· 최대한 빨리 끝낼게.
This is the date grid.····· These little pieces are called tokens.	여기가 데이트 그리드야.····· 이 작은 조각들이 바로 토큰이야.
You earn affection by matching three or more of the circular tokens horizontally or vertically.	가로나 세로로 동그란 토큰을 세 개 이상 맞추면 호감도를 얻어요.
For a successful date,····· you have to fill the affection meter before you run out of moves.	성공적인 데이트를 하려면,····· 제한된 기회 안에 호감도를 꽉 채워야 해.
Go ahead,····· give it a shot.····· Match those orange ones with the crescent shape in the middle of the grid.	자, 해봐····· 한 번 시도해봐.····· 저 주황색 애들을 그리드 한가운데 초승달 모양이랑 맞춰봐.
See?····· Easy!	봤지?······ 쉽잖아!
Each of the four types of Affection tokens represents a particular trait.	네 가지 종류의 호감 토큰은 각각 특정한 성향을 나타내요.
The orange ones represent Romance,····· blue is Talent,····· green is Flirtation··· and red is Sexuality.	주황색은 로맨스를,····· 파란색은 재능을,····· 초록색은 플러팅을··· 그리고 빨간색은 섹슈얼리티를 뜻해.
Pay attention to which trait your date prefers!····· It'll go a long way.	상대가 어떤 성향을 좋아하는지 신경 써!····· 그게 아주 큰 차이를 만들어.
Of course matching four or five tokens will get you even more affection.	당연히 토큰을 네 개나 다섯 개 맞추면 호감도가 훨씬 더 올라가지.
I'll show you.····· Match those four Sexuality tokens in the bottom right of the grid.····· The red ones.	내가 보여줄게······ 그리드 오른쪽 아래에 있는 네 개의 섹슈얼리티 토큰을 맞춰봐······ 빨간 색깔 말이야.
Sweet.····· Okay,····· what's next...	좋아.····· 그럼····· 다음은 뭐지...
Oh right.····· Let me cover the other token types real quick.	아, 맞다.····· 다른 토큰 타입들도 금방 설명해줄게.
The pink hearts are Passion tokens.····· Matching those will raise your date's Passion level.	핑크 하트는 패션 토큰이야.····· 저걸 맞추면 데이트의 패션 레벨이 올라가.
The higher her passion level is,····· the more affection you'll earn.	그녀의 열정 수치가 높을수록,····· 너는 더 많은 애정을 얻게 돼.
The gold bells are Joy tokens.····· You'll get an extra move by matching those;····· very useful.	금방울은 즐거움 토큰이야.····· 그거 매치하면 추가로 한 번 더 움직일 수 있어;····· 꽤 유용하지.
The Broken Heart tokens are bad news.····· Seriously,····· avoid matching those as best you can.	깨진 하트 토큰은 진짜 재수 없어.····· 진심으로····· 웬만하면 절대 맞추지 마.
Finally,····· the tear drops are Sentiment tokens.····· Matching those gives you...····· well,····· Sentiment.	드디어····· 저 눈물방울이 감정 토큰이야.····· 그거 맞추면...····· 그러니까,····· 감정을 얻게 돼.
You need Sentiment in order to use date gifts.	데이트 선물을 사용하려면 감정이 필요해.
Annnnnnd seeing as how you don't have any date gifts...····· I'm guessing I need to explain that too?	으으으으—and 데이트 선물도 없는 거 보니까······ 이것도 내가 설명해줘야겠다 그치?
Here,····· I'll hook you up with one of mine.····· It's on the house.	여기,····· 내 거 하나 줄게.····· 서비스야.
Like I said,····· you'll need Sentiment to use it.	말했잖아,····· 그걸 쓰려면 센티멘트가 필요해.
So go ahead and match those three Sentiment tokens in the left most column.····· The tear drops.	그럼 이제 가장 왼쪽 칸에 있는 감정 토큰 세 개를 맞춰봐.····· 저 눈물 방울 말이야.
Okay,····· now go ahead and give that date gift to me.	자,····· 이제 그 데이트 선물 내놔.
Cool huh?	멋지지?
There are like,··· a ton of different date gifts that you can get too.	데이트 선물도 진짜 엄청 다양하게 있어.
They each have a unique effect on the date and can be extremely useful in combination.	각 아이템마다 데이트에 특별한 효과가 있어서, 조합해서 쓰면 정말 유용해.
Oh,·····*cccc*·· and thanks to a little fairy magic,····· you'll never actually lose them.	오,·····*cccc*·· 그리고 작은 요정의 마법 덕분에,····· 절대 잃어버릴 일 없을 거야.
So you can use them on your next date too!····· Is that cool or what?	그러니까 다음 데이트 때도 쓸 수 있다고!······ 짱이지, 안 그래?
Alright,····· alright.····· I've gone on long enough.	알았어,····· 알았다고.····· 나도 이제 그만할게.
I'll let you finish up the date so you can get the hang of it.	이제 데이트 마무리는 네가 해봐. 어떻게 하는지 감 잡을 수 있을 거야.
Oh and don't worry,····· I won't let you fail this one.····· I'm not THAT mean.	아, 그리고 걱정 마,····· 이번엔 절대 망하게 안 할게.····· 나 그렇게까지 못됐진 않거든.
